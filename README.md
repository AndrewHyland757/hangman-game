## How to play

The player enters their name and the game begins. A word is generated randomally from a list and as the player
guesses correct letters the word is revealed. Only five incorrect attempts are allowed. When the player 
has two lives remaining a hint is provided. At the end of the game the player has the option to restart
and begin again with a new word. 


## Planning

### Goals

* The game should be challenging enogh to intice the player to continue playing

### Logic Flow Chart

Before I began to write the code I made a flow chart 

This helped answer questions like:

* How to detremin the eorder of the processes.
* How to deal with invalid inputs.
* How to deal with incorrect inputs.
